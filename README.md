# JS Calculator
Calculator written in vanilla JS

## Features

* operators +, -, *, /, ^ (power)
* Order of operation including brackets: `(3+2)/2 = 2.5`
* Functions (only sqrt is implemented)
	* `sqrt(9) = 3`
	* `sqrt((20-2)/2) = 3`
	* `sqrt(2(8)) = 4`

## Running

There are no build steps; this is vanilla JS after all. Just open index.html in a browser.

## WARNING

This code was written circa 2018. There may be unintended bugs. There are also no convenience features at all (on-screen keyboard, tab completion for functions, previous input history). These things are all endeavors for a future project that uses more modern tools.
